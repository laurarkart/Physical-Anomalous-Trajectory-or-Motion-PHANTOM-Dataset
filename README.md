# Physical Anomalous Trajectory or Motion (PHANTOM) Dataset
## Description
This dataset contains the six different classes as described in our paper[]. These classes are designed to be used to detect anomalies in physical videos and are meant to be used as a benchmark to assess a method's performance on physical videos. The train set contains normal videos, the test set contains both normal and anomalous videos.

In addition, we provide a script to obtain the test and train video id's of the Something-Something V2 dataset. This too is meant to serve as even more difficult benchmark for general video anomaly detection. Our approach is decribed in the paper.
